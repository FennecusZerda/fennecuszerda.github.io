		<h1>Palm SpringsPalm Springs Accessible Home</h1>
		<p>
			The Palm Springs Accessible Home was my first studio project. This project consisted of designing a
			one-story home with accessible features to meet the needs of a certain client.
		</p>
		<h2>Client Bio</h2>
		<p>
			Kim and Patricia - Kim is a single woman in her 50â€™s and is the daughter of Patricia, age 80. She takes care
			of her retired mother who has severe vision loss (but not blindness) due to glaucoma. They would like their
			home to reflect the Palm Springs history of the Hollywood Regency style. The home will be designed using the
			principles of universal design.
		</p>
		<h2>Research</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The home is built on a slab and is one floor</li>
			<li>
				Use principles of universal design throughout the home. Make sure that rooms are wheelchair accessible
				and make sure the home is traversable for someone with glaucoma.
			</li>
			<li>
				Tactile objects and cues that lean into touching and feeling things are good for someone with glaucoma.
			</li>
			<li>
				The Hollywood Regency style includes characteristics of bold colors, symmetrical patterns and motifs,
				and curvilinear architecture.
			</li>
			<li>
				Adding white and grey to blue and orange color schemes will bring freshness and clarity to the feel of
				the design.
			</li>
			<li>Proper lighting (including lots of task lighting) is a big deal for glaucoma patients.</li>
			<li>Another term for Hollywood Regency is Regency Moderne</li>
			<li>Interiors for Hollywood Regency homes should focus on luxury and comfort.</li>
