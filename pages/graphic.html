	<h3>Lofi by the Lake</h3>
	<p>
		Lofi by the lake is a brand and YouTube channel created by myself and a close friend. The graphic design poster
		was for a high school project, but the YouTube channel and art are more of a passion project for us. We havenâ€™t
		uploaded in a long time, but feel free to check out our old mixes!
